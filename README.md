##Description

This project is just to demonstrate how authentication can be added to mern-starter project.

##Details
When I started working with mern-starter I found it annoyed taht I could not get any boiler plate of mern project with authentication included. I struggled, studied various other project and then tried to put authentication in mern-starter package.

##Known Issues:
-logout is not implemented yet.
- During server side renderinglocalStorage is not working, due to which even though app is logged in and closed/re-opened it asks for login again.
- There seems to be some styling issues, due to which flickering happens during login
